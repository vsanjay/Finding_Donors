    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "### Implementation: Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "\n",
    "## Decision Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real world Applications **\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision tree is used almost in every field like agriculture,software development,medicine.You can find full list  [here](http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/~salzberg/docs/murthy_thesis/survey/node32.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths **\n",
    "\n",
    "First thing is Decision trees are easy to use.They also can gain knowledge about non-linear relationship data.They are robust to outliers.In my perspective decision tree perform well when it could find splits with good information gain so it can learn more about the data.Also it performs well when it doesnt end up being a complex tree which can lead to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weakness**\n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness of decision is that it is prone to overfitting when it has lots and lots of features.It can grow fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applicability **\n",
    "\n",
    "Well,First thing this is a classification problem which decision trees are said to be good at.This data doesnt have lot of features so it wont to overfitting.Even if it does we can try tuning to get rid of it.Decsison trees are easy to visualize which could really help this problem of finding donors in my perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "** Real world Applications **\n",
    "\n",
    "* To mark an email as spam, or not spam ?\n",
    "* Classify a news article about technology, politics, or sports \n",
    "* Also used for face recognition softwares\n",
    "* Check a piece of text expressing positive emotions, or negative emotions\n",
    "\n",
    "** Strengths **\n",
    "\n",
    "* Easy to implement.\n",
    "* They can scale with your dataset.\n",
    "* Fast training speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Weakness ** \n",
    "\n",
    "* Due to their sheer simplicity, NB models are often beaten by models properly trained and tuned using the other algorithms.\n",
    "* They assume every feature is independent which could sometime be a wrong assumption.\n",
    "* If data is scarce this classifier wont predict well.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Applicability **\n",
    "\n",
    "I think this a binary classification problem is something like other problem NB classifier could solve such as finding a spam email or checking if a review is positive or negative.So,i think this is similar kind of problem where we wanna classify data.Also we have enough data that can train a NB Model.So,this is one of my 3 classifiers i will use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Support Vector Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "** Real world Applications **\n",
    "\n",
    "Support vector machines algorithm is the most popular algorithm in the field of machine learning.It is generally used to classify linearly seperable data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Face detection\n",
    "* Text and hypertext categorization\n",
    "* Classification of images\n",
    "* Protein fold and remote homology detection\n",
    "\n",
    "** Strengths **\n",
    "\n",
    "* SVM's can model non-linear decision boundaries, and there are many kernels to choose from. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "** Weakness ** \n",
    "\n",
    "* SVM's are memory intensive, trickier to tune due to the importance of picking the right kernel, and don't scale well to larger datasets. Currently in the industry, random forests are usually preferred over SVM's.\n",
    "* SVM's can lead to overfitting.\n",
    "* They are slow if data is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Applicability **\n",
    "\n",
    "Well,i think this dataset is not that big.Besides,this is a classification problem so i think we can seperate the data pretty well by tuning the parameters correctly."

    "\n",
    "With our past experiences on this types of data you provided we first chose 3 different models which could work well for this kind of data.They are NB Classifier,Support Vector Machine(SVM),Decision Tree Models.We considered two metrics to evaluate respective model.Those are **Accuracy** and **F-Score**.The more the F-score is closer to one the best the model will perform.\n",

    "Now lets put some more balls on table and now we see that our stick still seperates two balls almost correctly except one.Well its kinda bad right?If you observe clearly in image our stick can still seperate these balls correctly if we used that stick in a different way.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Photo 3](images/photo3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let me just tell you how SVM's work.SVM always try to put the stick in such a way that the distance from the stick to nearest points is maximum.If we now consider this and place our stick,this is how our stick will be now.You can see that our stick is now at some distance from nearest points and this is maximum.\n",

    "![Photo 6](images/photo6.png)\n",

    "Here Stick,Paper is our SVM Classifier.Balls are the data.Flying the balls is kernal trick in SVM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The balls on table before adding some extra balls is the training data.We train our SVM Model and draw a seperating line which is at maximum distance from nearest data points besides seperating them as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if we have a new data point and want to predict, to which class does this data point belong to, we can just put this in our model and see where on which side of seperating line is our data point and we are done.Its that simple to predict.\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
